/**
 * A badge is a red number that appears over an app's icon, indicating to the user that the app has something new to share. Like a ringtone alerts a person to pick up the phone, a badge alerts users to open the app.
 * In a normal scenario, the IoT Software Suite will send a push notification to the user's apps to automatically place a badge on top of the app's icon(s). The total badge counts can be manually obtain from the /user GET API. It is the app's responsibility to clear its own local badges, and to alert the server to reset the badge counter when the user finally responds.
