// Electricity customers are billed on how much energy their homes, businesses, and appliances consume. The IoT Software Suite enables post-processing and analytics on energy measurements, to slice and dice the data as needed to create a valuable user experience.
// The IoT Software Suite contains a Utility Rates Database in the backend to map utility names to their current rates and pricing information. This data can help smooth out the deployment of energy-related programs, and greatly improve the user experience by converting the nebulous units of kilowatt-hours into something more user friendly, like monetary value.

// Green Button
// The United States national Green Button standard was originally created by and spun out of People Power Company with John Teeter, People Power's Chief Scientist.
// Green Button API's are implemented according to http://services.greenbuttondata.org/All API's have URI prefix {server}/espapi/gb/xml/.

/**
 * Get Device Energy Usage.
 * Return a device's values of power, billing rate, its associated cost, total energy usage, and its cost for the current day, month and year.
 * By default, this API returns total device values. To get the values for the specific part of a device, use an index number (assuming the device supports parameters with index numbers).
 * This method uses the time zone ID from the device location to calculate values. If the time zone is not set, it uses the default server time zone.

/**
 * Get Aggregated Energy Usage for a Device.

#pragma mark - Get Billing Information

/**
 * Get Billing Information.
 * The IoT Software Suite contains a billing rates database capable of storing flat-rate, time-of-use, and tiered pricing schemes for utility billing. This group of APIs tracks billing information, and also tracks the user's customizable budget information to help keep them on track.
 * A billing day is the day when the user gets charged by the utility. The billing day is an integer representing a single day of the month, like "28" for the 28th day of the month. Each billing cycle ends on the day before the billing day, at 23:59:59. A new billing cycle starts at 00:00:00 on the billing day.

/**
 * Update Billing Information.
 * Update the billing day, billing rate, and budget information. All fields are optional.
