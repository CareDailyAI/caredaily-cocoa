     Questions let us discover information about our user base, automatically tag users, drive engagement programs. Questions are the mechanism for a bi-directional conversation with the end user.Note these tables are replicated in the Composer Analytics API documentation and the Cloud API documentation.CollectionQuestions in organizations are organized by collections. Each question belongs to one or multiple question collections.
     | Name | Description | Description |
     | ---- | ---- | ---- |
     | id | integer | Collection ID |
     | name | string | A unique name for referencing this collection. |
     | descriptions | string | The titles of the group in various languages. |
     | status | integer | 0 - inactive; 1 - active |
     | generalPublic | boolean | If true, this question will be made available publicly only outside of the organization, even to users who have never signed up on our system before. This is to facilitate sign up surveys. The user's answers will get captured immediately after  | their | account | is created on the server.; If false, this question is available only for approved users inside the organization. |
     | order | integer | A number set by the admin to indicate where this question should appear relative to other questions inside a collection. The lower the order, the higher the question rises up to the top. |

Available for anonymous aggregated public reporting.; 1 = Drop-down list / Picker. A drop down list. Same as radio buttons, but can contain more items. |
     | 4 | Multiple choice - Multiple select | A list of checkbox options. Requires the "responses" array to list the possible responses. Users can select multiple responses. Available for anonymous aggregated public reporting. |
     | 6 | Day of the week | Day of the week input. This is similar to a Checkbox input, except the UI can optimize itself for days of the week [Sun][XXX][Tue][Wed][Thu][XXX][Sat]. |
     | 7 | Slider | 0 = Integer select - default. Slider, with a defined minimum and maximum. By default, minimum = 0 and maximum = 100.; 1 = Floating point select.; 2 = Minutes:Seconds (answer is in total seconds). |
     | 8 | Time in seconds since midnight | 0 = hours:minutes:seconds (am|pm) - default.; 1 = hours:minutes (am|pm). This accesses the native UI method of declaring a time. |
     | 9 | Date and Time in xsd:dateTime | 0 = Date and time. 1 = Date only. |
     | 10 | Text box | Open-ended question. For example, if you were to ask, "Who just walked by the camera?" |

    /**
     Ask a Question
     Non-public questions should act like messaging. By default, questions are always delivered into the app. Admins can choose to also deliver the messages via push notification or email as well. When delivered over email, it would be ideal, if the recipient could answer the question directly in his or her email without leaving the email experience. Emails should have a nice template with the logo and name of the app that generated the email. It would also be ideal for those email messages to have the option to manage subscriptions on further organization questions emails.Urgency lets us decide when to ask the question. The system should marshall questions to the user in a way that does not blast them with many questions at once. The user should receive at most one non-urgent question each day from all of their apps combined. Urgent questions should be delivered immediately to the user, and usually the developer will also select push-notifications for truly urgent messages. If multiple urgent questions are asked, they should all get delivered together to the user, and take precedence over non-urgent questions.Questions can be put into the queue and manually delayed by a specific number of days. This enables engagement programs where people sign up at their own pace, and the questions are all relative to the time at which those people signed up. This enables a time-shifted engagement program.Each message instance has an ID that can later be used to manage the question.This will create a single instance of this question that is referenced by an ID, and the question itself will appear in multiple user's accounts a time when it is appropriate to present that question to each individual user.
